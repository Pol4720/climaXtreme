## What This Enables

The generated codebase provides:

1. **Complete Climate Analysis Platform** - From raw data ingestion to advanced analytics
2. **Scalable Processing** - Handles datasets from MB to TB scale
3. **Interactive Exploration** - Web-based dashboard for non-technical users
4. **Reproducible Research** - Version-controlled analysis with consistent environments
5. **Production Deployment** - Docker-based deployment with CI/CD
6. **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to add new data sources, analysis methods, or ML models

## Getting Started

The project is immediately usable after generation:

1. Run `./scripts/setup.sh` for automated setup
2. Use `climaxtreme ingest` to download data
3. Process with `climaxtreme preprocess`
4. Explore via `climaxtreme dashboard`

This creates a professional-grade climate analysis platform suitable for research, education, or production use.

## Dashboard Big Data mode (memory-safe)

The Streamlit dashboard now includes memory protection features designed for large datasets:

- Big data mode (enabled by default):
  - CSV is read in chunks up to a configurable "Max rows to load" (default: 1,000,000)
  - Parquet is read fully and then randomly sampled to the same limit
  - Numeric columns are downcast to reduce RAM
  - Date parsing adds year/month/day in-place without duplicating the DataFrame
- Max points to plot (default: 200,000):
  - Scatter/box plots are downsampled to this cap to avoid oversized WebSocket payloads and browser freezes
- Heatmap anomalies are computed with vectorized operations (no row-wise apply)

If you experienced the app freezing or Tornado/WebSocket exceptions, keep Big data mode on and tune the limits in the sidebar according to your machine's RAM.
